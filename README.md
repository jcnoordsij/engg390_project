# Test plan tracker
This is the test plan tracking app that I implemented while interning at Macom Technology Solutions. It was my first foray into Python other than some rudimentary data analysis in Jupyter notebooks. I was also completely new to web development, so I learned a ton about both subjects even though it was a very simple project.
